OneDrive doesn't appear in the\nnavigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud. Users\ncan't automatically upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.\nNote: If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users\nfrom saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive.\nNote #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and\ntherefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you\nalso obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest\nOneDrive client, as noted at this link (this template is not included with the Windows\nAdministrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that\ntemplate are worth your consideration:\n• Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations - a computer-\nbased setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant\nIDs.\n• Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts - a user-based\nsetting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).\nPage 1067",
