    "rationale": "Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network\nas the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can\npotentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and\nforward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the\nattacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain\nunauthorized access to data.\nSMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating\nsystems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures\nauthenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the\nauthentication process, data transmission will not take place.\nPage 196",
    "impact": "The Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the\nclient. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be\nnegotiated.\nThe Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003,\nWindows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print\nsharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking\nattacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\nSMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB,\nwhich is then verified by both the client and the server.\nImplementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each\npacket needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is\nperforming multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain\nController, file server, print server, and application server performance may be\nsubstantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned\nSMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to\nconnect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be\nvulnerable to session hijacking attacks.\nWhen SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows\nServer 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server\n2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves\nthis issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy\nsettings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008\nor Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled.",
