    "description": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating\nWindows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single\nnetwork. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user\nsecurity features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the\nKerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos\nprotocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or\nNTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2\n(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients\nwhen they perform the following operations:\n• Join a domain\n• Authenticate between Active Directory forests\n• Authenticate to down-level domains\n• Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,\nor Windows XP\n• Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which\nchallenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice\naffects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security\nnegotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM\n& NTLM.\nPage 243",
    "rationale": "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and\nNTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients\nonly send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server\n2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.\nHowever, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response -\nwere sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that\ntraffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the\nKerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server\n2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM\nprotocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication\nprotocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the\nlogon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process.\nEven if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and\nservers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to\nauthenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these\nreasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as\npossible.",
