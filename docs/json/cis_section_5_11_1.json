    "description": "Manages Internet SCSI (iSCSI) sessions from this computer to remote target devices.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.",
    "rationale": "This service is critically necessary in order to directly attach to an iSCSI device.\nHowever, iSCSI itself uses a very weak authentication protocol (CHAP), which means\nthat the passwords for iSCSI communication are easily exposed, unless all of the traffic\nis isolated and/or encrypted using another technology like IPsec. This service is\ngenerally more appropriate for servers in a controlled environment then on workstations\nrequiring high security.",
