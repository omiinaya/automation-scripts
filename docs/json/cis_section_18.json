User SIDs for\nthis scenario always begin with S-1-5-21-* for active directory domain-joined\naccounts.\nThe group policy engine applies user configuration settings to the HKU\\SID subkeys for\ninteractive logons, including local console logons, remote desktop logons, and RunAs\nlogons. User configuration settings are not applied to the built-in NT AUTHORITY\nservice accounts (System, Network Service, and Local Service), nor to any other\nservice logons. User configuration settings configured through active directory domain\ngroup policy objects (GPO) are not applied to local user accounts.\nWhen validating user configuration settings for compliance, each recommendation\nshould be checked against all currently-logged-on interactive users’ hives:\n• Audit all HKEY_USERS subkeys with key names beginning with S-1-5-21-*\nand do not end with _Classes.\n• Do not audit subkeys named .DEFAULT, S-1-5-18, S-1-5-19, or S-1-5-20.\n• Do not audit any NT SERVICE SIDs (S-1-5-80-).\n• Do not load the hives of users that are not currently logged on (NTUSER.DAT\nfiles) as part of compliance verification.\nA user configuration setting is considered in compliance if the correct configuration is\nfound in all applicable user hives as described above. If there are multiple users logged\non and the setting is correctly configured in some but not all the applicable user hives,\nthe recommendation is not in full compliance.\nIf a system has no actively logged-on users, the recommendations in this section are\nnot considered out of compliance. User accounts (S-1-5-21-*) that only log on as a\nservice (service accounts), will not receive user configuration settings to its HKU\nregistry hive since the group policy engine will not write to this type of account.\nCompliance findings for these accounts should be ignored.\nPage 1245\nWhy CIS recommends not auditing all the HKU subkeys:\n• Group policy applies user configuration settings only to HKU subkey hives\nassociated with interactive logons. It never applies the settings to the NT\nAUTHORITY service account subkeys (S-1-5-18, S-1-5-19, S-1-5-20, or\n.DEFAULT) or the NT SERVICE subkeys (S-1-5-80-*).\no The HKU\\S-1-5-18 is a symbolic link to HKU\\.DEFAULT, so the key\ncontent is identical.\n• The HKU\\SID_Classes subkey represents the subkey of the corresponding\nHKU\\SID\\SOFTWARE\\Classes, to which they are symbolically linked.\nWhy CIS recommends not loading the NTUSER.DAT file(s) to audit the hives of users\nthat are not currently logged on:\n• Unnecessary false positives of old user profiles that were last loaded before the\nnew or updated GPO containing the user configuration settings were applied.\no These accounts would be found out of compliance, with no supportable\nway to bring them into compliance other than the user logging on or\ndeleting the old profiles.\no These account settings being out of compliance should not cause issues if\nthe user never logs on; and if they do, a group policy update should bring\nthem into compliance.\n• Risk of system issues if the user logs on while the scanning tool has the hive\nloaded, and then also when the scanning tool unloads the hive.\n• Significant performance hit.\nUser configuration settings configured through active directory domain GPOs are not\napplied to local user accounts. Since these accounts begin with the SID S-1-5-21-*, a\nfailure may occur with CIS-CAT and other third-party assessment tools. To mitigate this,\nuser recommendations (Section 19 of this benchmark) should be applied to local\naccounts separately. If this is not a concern for the organization, local accounts should\nbe ignored. The above is also true when an account with a S-1-5-21-* SID logs on as\na service.\nPage 1246",
