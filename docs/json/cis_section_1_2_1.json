Users should be aware of the\nlength of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help\ndesk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.
