Reverting a change to this policy setting can\nrequire manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should\nnever be applied to a Domain Controller.\nA client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to\ncommunicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have\nspecifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from\nthis restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.\n• \"None\" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine\non which the policy setting is applied.\n• \"Authenticated\" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above)\nto connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is\napplied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.\n• \"Authenticated without exceptions\" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per\nthe definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on\nwhich the policy setting is applied.
